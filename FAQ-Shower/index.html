            What is Amazon.com?
        </h3>

        <p class="faq-text">
            Amazon.com is a leading online retailer of products that inform, educate, and inspire. The Amazon group also has stores in the Canada, Germany, France, Japan and United Kingdom. Because we exist "virtually" on the Web, we have unlimited shelf space and can offer a selection of over 17 million titles including over 13 million Book titles and over 1 million music titles. Compare that to a typical physical-world book superstore, which carries around 170,000 books, or a typical physical-world music superstore, which carries around 34,000 CDs.

            Why do I encounter various availability listings on your site?
        </h3>

        <p class="faq-text">
            Titles have different availabilities simply due to their demand, proximity, and availability to Amazon.com. We also source our products from various distributors. The availability on products we obtain from distributors may vary according to whether the distributor has the product in stock or not.

            If a title is listed as out of stock or unavailable, it means that it is not currently available to Amazon.com or not in stock through our distribution channels. However, you may still be able to sell out of stock items through our Marketplace feature.

            What does the sales rank mean?
        </h3>

        <p class="faq-text">
            Our sales rank is just like a bestseller list, except instead of listing just the top 50 or so titles, it includes millions! The lower the number, the higher the popularity for that particular title in comparison to other items listed. Items are ranked within their product category only, so a book, CD or DVD ranked at Number 1 is the best-selling book, CD or DVD at Amazon.com, but may not be the overall best-selling item.

            How do I find sales information for my title?
        </h3>

        <p class="faq-text">
            We don't provide sales information to vendors at this time due to the competitive nature of our business. It is recommended that authors/artists/actors contact their publisher/label/studio, or publishers/labels/studios contact their distributors, for more information concerning the sales of their titles.

            Why are some titles discounted while others are not?
        </h3>

        <p class="faq-text">
            Our decision to discount products is made internally and based on a number of strategic considerations which can vary over time. As it stands now, we offer discounts on hundreds of thousands of selected titles. However we cannot confirm when, if ever, a title will be discounted or how long a title once discounted will remain so.
